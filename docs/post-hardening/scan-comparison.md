# Scan Comparison: Post-Hardening Analysis

## Overview
This document compares the scan results before and after applying the system hardening measures. The focus is on identifying key changes, new vulnerabilities, and improvements observed in the system.

---

## Key Findings

### Vulnerabilities Resolved
1. **OpenSSH Race Condition**: The issue identified in the initial scan was resolved by modifying the SSH configuration to:
   - Disable root login.
   - Restrict user access to specific accounts.
   - Implement SSH key authentication.

2. **SSL Certificate Issue**: Updated the self-signed SSL certificate to meet secure configuration standards, resolving related vulnerabilities.

---

### New Vulnerabilities
1. **Service Detection Issues**:
   - Additional informational vulnerabilities related to service detection appeared post-hardening. These require further investigation to confirm whether they pose significant risks.

2. **Port Scanning Insights**:
   - The latest scan highlighted potential open ports that were not flagged in the initial scan, emphasizing the need for more strict port management.

### Comparison Summary

| Category               | Initial Scan       | Post-Hardening Scan |
|------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Total Vulnerabilities  | 50                | 50                 |
| Critical Vulnerabilities | 1               | 0                  |
| High Vulnerabilities    | 2                | 0                  |
| Info Vulnerabilities    | 47               | 50                 |

## Recommendations
1. Regularly monitor for new vulnerabilities and apply patches as necessary.
2. Close unnecessary ports and limit the number of active services.
3. Conduct periodic vulnerability scans to maintain system integrity.

## Conclusion
The hardening process successfully resolved several critical and high-priority vulnerabilities, particularly those related to SSH configuration and SSL certificates. However, additional steps are required to address newly identified informational vulnerabilities and further improve system security.
